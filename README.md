- ***Software: computer programs and associated documentation … It may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market.***
- ***Software Engineering: the establishment and use of engineering principles to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently.***

### ***Software development life***

- ***Early software development was untrusted each new user = a new program with no reuse.***
- ***Then they made one program that a new user = new function but it led to spaghetti code.***
- ***All that because of the bad dealing with requirements.***

- ***All of that led to software Crisis, then Software Engineering raise to solve these problems.***

### *Software crisis*

- ***It refers to difficulty of writing correct, understandable and verifiable programs.***

- ***Factors:***
    - ***Increasing complexity.***
    - ***The only concern is to satisfy user needs.***
    - ***Lack of professionals in SWE.***
    - ***Lack of progress in SWE discipline.***
    - ***Low productivity improvements.***

- ***Symptoms:***
    - ***Projects running over-budget.***
    - ***Projects running over-time.***
    - ***Software was of low quality.***
    - ***Projects were unmanageable and unmaintainable.***
    - ***Unreliable projects that full of bugs.***

---

### *SE Methodologies*

- ***The main thing is to apply the methodology until you may not satisfy all user needs… We have:***
    - ***Methodology assessment: that determine that is true or anything.***
    - ***Anti-methodology (Ad-hoc Development): that leads to spaghetti code.***
    - ***Methodology with modification.***

### ***Software myths***

- ***These myths can mislead stakeholders causing unrealistic expectations and poor decision-making … They can be classified into:***
    - ***Management myths.***
        - ***If we fall behind schedule, we can add more programmers to catch up.***
        - ***A good project manager can accurately estimate time and cost without detailed analysis.***
        - ***Once we finalize the requirement, there won’t be any changes.***
    - ***Customer myths.***
        - ***Software is easy to change at any stage.***
        - ***A general statement of objectives in enough; developers will figure out the details.***
        - ***If we build a prototype, the final system will be ready soon.***
    - ***Developer myths.***
        - ***If my program complies and runs, it is error-free.***
        - ***The best way to improve software quality is through extensive testing.***
        - ***Working software is more important than documentation.***

### ***Elements of SE***

- ***SE methods:***
    - ***provides the technical “how to” for building software that includes requirements, analysis, testing and maintenance.***
- ***SE process:***
    - ***The sequence in which methods will be applied.***
    - ***The deliverables that are required.***
    - ***The controls that help ensure quality and coordinate change.***
- ***SE tools:***
    - ***Provides automated and semi-automated support for methods and process.***
    - ***Called computer-aided software engineering CASE.***

---

### ***SE activities***

- ***Categorized into three generic phases, regardless of application are, size or complexity.***
    - ***The definition phase: focuses on “WHAT”. Such as what the information, behavior and constraints exist … Tasks done during this phase:***
        - ***System analysis.***
        - ***Software project planning.***
        - ***Requirement analysis.***
    - ***The implementation phase: focuses on “HOW”. That the SW engineer attempts to define how data be structed and functions implemented … Tasks done during this phase:***
        - ***Software design.***
        - ***Code generation.***
        - ***Software testing.***
    - ***The maintenance phase: focuses on the change that may occur on software after delivered such as:***
        - ***Correction: correcting the errors that are uncovered by the customer.***
        - ***Adaptation: modifying the software to adapt changes in external environment.***
        - ***Enhancement: extending the software functions to meet new requirements.***
        - ***Re-engineering: making changes to be more easily corrected, adapted, and enhanced.***
